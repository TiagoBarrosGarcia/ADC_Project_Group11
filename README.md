# ADC_Project_Group11
Network exploration and analysis
Each group will select a publicly available dataset and perform a detailed analysis upon it. It should include a literature review on the dataset, an explanation of its importance and value, and an specialised analysis focusing on the network characteristics and properties.

Students will submit a full report with the analysis by Sunday, December 8

Assignment Instructions

From The Stanford Large Network Database students will select a dataset that must not be too small.
The dataset selected needs to be sent for approval by the lecturer by presenting the selection on the Students' Forum 
NOTE: No two groups may select the same dataset, so choices will be assigned on a first come, first served rule
Properly justified, a group may select a dataset from another repository
For the analysis, a subset of the full dataset needs to be created
Students need to detail and justify the procedure used for creating the subset
The report will include 
A literature review and previous efforts for modelling and using the full dataset
A description of the procedure for creating the subset and a justification of the criterion used.
A thorough analysis of the network subset with the methods described in class. The analysis should provide, for each computed statistic/element of study, an interpretation, eventually comparing to results of the full network in case it exists in the literature
Furthermore:
The report should be in one of the ACM LateX Templates.  It is strongly recommended that students use overleaf for writing their report
Source code should not appear on the report unless strictly necessary. All source code should be provided in a public repository page (as Github) on a specially created repository for the course. NOTE: If Jupyter notebooks are to be used, they should be stored on Github fully executed or an HTML copy of the executed notebook be presented
Students name and number should appear on the first page of the report
The link of the repository with the source code and the data should be presented on the report
The report should not be longer than 12 pages
